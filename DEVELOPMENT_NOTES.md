# Development Notes

## Admin Authentication Flow

### Expected Behavior (This is Normal!)

When you visit `/admin` without being logged in, you will see:

```
GET http://localhost:3000/api/auth/me 401 (Unauthorized)
```

**This is the correct and expected behavior!** Here's what happens:

1. 🚪 Visit `/admin`
2. 🔍 System checks if you're authenticated (`/api/auth/me`)
3. ❌ Returns 401 because you're not logged in (this is correct!)
4. ↩️ Automatically redirects you to `/admin/login`

### How to Use the Admin System

1. **Go to the login page**: http://localhost:3000/admin/login
2. **Log in with admin credentials** (you'll need to set these up)
3. **Access the admin dashboard**: http://localhost:3000/admin

### Environment Setup

Make sure your `.env.local` file includes:

```env
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here-change-in-production
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
```

### Console Messages You Can Ignore

- ✅ `GET /api/auth/me 401 (Unauthorized)` - Expected when not logged in
- ✅ React DevTools download suggestion - Optional development tool
- ✅ CSS preload warnings - Minor optimization warnings

### Actual Problems to Watch For

- ❌ Network errors (connection failures)
- ❌ 500 Internal Server Error
- ❌ Missing environment variables (JWT_SECRET)
- ❌ Database connection issues

## Current Status

✅ **Your application is working correctly!**  
✅ **All metadata warnings have been fixed**  
✅ **Missing icon files have been resolved**  
✅ **The 401 error is expected security behavior**

The authentication system is functioning properly and protecting your admin routes as intended.
